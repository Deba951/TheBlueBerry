# Bon Hack√©tit 2023 project - The Blue Berry


  Idea:
  A review of a new restaurant that just opened in your city, with a focus on its unique menu items and atmosphere.


   Through this website a resturant "THE BLUE BERRY" allow users to :
  
  * **Restaurant allows to make order at table through this website.**
  * **Restaurant staffs occasionally upload food blogs, which are basically tutorials of different dishes made by them in this website.**
  * **Restaurant allows you to order food at home through this website.**



## How we built it
  The first thing came to our mind was a restaurant where we can dine in. Then we thought of making a web portal for a restaurant through which customers can order food at their table or even order food online at the door steps.
  While adding testimonials and the restaurant teams along with owner, we though of adding a blog section where the staffs occasionally would upload food blogs, which are basically tutorials of different dishes made by them to attract customer's view on the restaurant.
